## "Like when the dream no longer needs its dreamer..." - [PELINAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5ix0_W-ouI)

The Nightmare. It is a dark and twisted version of Nirn beneath a pale red moon. The land is filled with an endless fog that gives the countless horrors a place to hide. 

Hunt, Dreamer. You have no other choice. There are no safe places but those you carve out for yourself. There is no happiness but what is bought with iron and blood. Face down the Daedra and the dead, and win yourself a place in the world that belongs only to you.

Unless...perhaps...you would offer your soul to those seeking champions...?

*A Hunter's Daedream* is a modlist for those seeking a darker Tamriel. No museums here, nor Dwemer time shenanigans, nor awkward scholars and singing cannibal wood elves and funny blue cats. *Daedream* is a tightly-focused modpack based on giving the user a dark fantasy experience with accessible performance and a surprisingly small install size. *Daedream* was designed with SkySA and True Directional Movement in mind - it was born out of my personal desire to play VIGILANT, GLENMORIL, and UNSLAAD the way I feel they were meant to be played. Every mod in *Daedream* has been selected to offer that dark fantasy experience, with a few optional mechanics for those seeking an even more brutal experience than the baseline.

WARNING: *A Hunter's Daedream* is a mature list, as to be expected of one focused around VICN's work. It is not porn - nevernude skins ensure that, and the only HDT is for capes - but it is dark fantasy, and the mods herein draw on uncomfortable and eerie inspiration. You've been warned.

WARNING 2: This modlist is currently in VERY ROUGH ALPHA. Expect graphical glitches. Expect some bugs, some overlapping items. The current focus of playtesting is **combat feel and missing features**. Players of this early alpha are asked to explore combat against a variety of foes and see how the game flows and feels, and what might be missing, and what might be added, to make the experience better. Features may be removed or added as time goes on.


Standard install instructions apply. See any other Readme for information.


## Noteworthy Mods

### Character Creation

Using *Skyrim Unbound*, a modified *Vokrii*, *Aetherius*, *Mundustar*, *Class Overhaul Re-Imagined: CORI*, and *Early Life Evaluation - EVE*, the player has a fair bit of freedom. A swordsman, a paladin, a heroic knight or an exiled thief - whatever background you can imagine helped you survive in the Nightmare, you can play it.

### Gameplay

*Daedream* relies on SkySA to deliver a smooth, behavior-driven combat experience. *The Ultimate Dodge Mod* and *ZXLice's Backstab & Parry* deliver new ways to evade and counter enemy attacks. *Armor Rating Redux*, *Know Your Armor*, and *Resistances Rescaled* offer the player some much-needed survivability in this harsh land. *ZXlice's Ultimate Potion Animation*, *(SGC) Normal Attacks Cost Stamina* and *(SGC) Soulslike Movement and Stamina Regen* completely change the way risk management works. Furthermore, the intended settings of the game **massively reduces the player's passive health regeneration**, encouraging either very deliberate combat, or very harsh and swift combat. Bring potions. Thankfully, bandits always have a lot of them. Less thankfully, draugr don't...

And if it's too easy or too tough for you? *Simply Balanced* is included. There's no shame in adjusting it to your liking.

### Items & Magic

A whole host of armors and weapons await, as well as the usual Summermyst enchantments. However, to properly emulate the feel of the games and stories *Daedream* is playing off of, *Passive Weapon Enchantment Recharging* has been included, with a configurable recharge timer. This allows you to play without feeling the urge to soultrap everything that moves, while still benefitting from the enchantments you either paid for or crafted yourself.

*Throwing Weapons Lite* will guarantee that you need to stay on your toes 24/7. Grenades and oil pots and throwing knives come from the enemy, too, and they're real, real mean. Fire is *very definitely* not your friend!

For magic, several of the usual suspects like Odin have made their way in, but mods like *Shadow Spells*, *Summermyst Spells*, *Witchhunter Spells & Prayers* (with a balancing patch), and *Shinobi Tools* have added a number of new tools for surviving the Nightmare.

### Quests

The obvious highlight of *A Hunter's Daedream* is the Vicn trilogy - VIGILANT, GLENMORIL, and UNSLAAD - and Darkend. But those are the ones everyone already knows.

*Dealing With Daedra* is a massive, sprawling mod that offers new ways to play, new organizations to interact with, and new forms of magic suitable for warlocks, witches, cultists, or hunters. *A Witcher's Adventure* further offers new magic suitable for non-mage playstyles, as well as offering players access to unique weapons and a whole new worldspace full of quests to enjoy. *Den of Cinder* similarly offers a new worldspace...one that's pitch black. Bring torches if you're wise.

*Headhunter* gives you real reasons to go do those bounty quests alongside *Trophies - An Add-On For Headhunter*. Now, when you kill a bandit leader or a giant, you get to carry their head around with you and get a bonus for it. Or you can just turn it in for money. It's up to you. This applies to the ever-present *Missives*, too.

### Appearance

The *Bijin*, *Kalilies'* and *Pandorable* mods were chosen to fit the visual style of *Glenmoril Overhaul* and *Vigilant Overhaul*. While people may hate the "supermodel Skyrim" look, dark fantasy has never had shortages of pretty people, and visual consistency is important. There is currently no child overhaul as I'm still trying to figure out which one I think best fits the visuals presented.

### Optionals For The Deranged

*Dark Corners of Nirn - Stress* adds a Darkest Dungeon-style Stress system into the game. While I don't personally use it, it's been presented as an option for those who want to really up the feeling of despair and hopelessness. Just...make sure you turn off the visual effect in the MCM. It's really unpleasant to look at. You may also want to adjust the rate at which you gain Stress; I found it can get *really* high *really* fast.


## Character Creation

**Wait until all messages in the upper left corner have gone through!**

The following MCM elements must be changed:

1) A Witcher's Adventure: Load settings.

2) Extended Encounters: Recommend setting Wilderness Encounters to 10% (no dragons) with Draugr Swarm, Location Encounters to 5%, and Sleep Encounters to 1% with no notifications.

3) Immersive World Encounters: Recommend setting all events to 10%, giving it 14 days between events, and removing Tavern Brawls and She's My Wife.

4) Resistances Rescaled: Remove Armor from the list.

5) Timing Is Everything: Load settings.

6) The Ultimate Dodge Mod: setup as you like it.

7) VioLens: Load profile "Skyborne."


From there, make your character as normal. A premade "Good Hunter" unbound preset has been loaded; it's recommended you pick your own starting gear according to how you see fit. If you instead wish to use the armor from the screenshot, see below.

## Post Creation

Open the console. Type help "[perk]" Give yourself the Insight perk, then go over to it in your inventory and take the first perk from it to get access to the Regain mechanic. While you don't technically have to do this, it'll probably make your life a bit easier, and the modlist is intended to be played with Regain unlocked from go.

Distribute your two additional perks.

Use the Reflect power to choose a background and get +10 to a skill of your choice.

Open the MCM.

Activate Ashes. Set it up as you like (I recommend disabling Injuries and Experience Loss).

Enable iEquip (or don't, if you're not playing on a controller). 

Set a hotkey for Grip Switch.

Enable Draugnarok.

Save the game. Quit to main menu. Load to allow Parry and Backstab to function.

Play.


OPTIONAL:

If you wish to use the armor from the screenshots, type "help Witch Hunter Coat" (or Witch Hunter's Coat, I forget) into the console. Witch Hunter set consists of Witch Hunter's Coat, Witch Hunter's Mask, Witch Hunter's Boots, Witch Hunter's Gloves, Witch Hunter's Hat.

If you wish for an even more difficult experience, open the console and type "player.setav healratemult -95". It will slow your healing to an absolute crawl, making it more or less impossible to sit and heal in dungeons without taking an incredible amount of time. **This is the intended setup for the modlist** but you do not need to do this to experience it.

## Things To Know

You can get a very solid pair of swords by running the Helgen cave and picking up the Old Silver Sword and Old Iron Sword, but note that the silver sword deals 20% less damage to humans and the Iron sword deals 20% less damage to everything else. The swords will also give Witcher Skill Tree experience.


## Final Thoughts

Don't give up, skeleton!
