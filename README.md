# A Hunter's Daedream

## "Like when the dream no longer needs the dreamer..." - [PELINAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5ix0_W-ouI)

The Nightmare. It is a dark and twisted version of Nirn beneath a pale red moon. The land is filled with an endless fog that gives the countless horrors a place to hide. 

Hunt, Dreamer. You have no other choice. There are no safe places but those you carve out for yourself. There is no happiness but what is bought with iron and blood. Face down the Daedra and the dead, and win yourself a place in the world that belongs only to you.

*A Hunter's Daedream* is a modlist for those seeking a darker Tamriel. No museums here, nor Dwemer time shenanigans, nor happy-go-lucky scholars and singing cannibal wood elves and funny blue cats. *Daedream* is a tightly-focused modpack based on giving the user a dark fantasy experience with accessible performance and a surprisingly small install size. *Daedream* was designed with SkySA and True Directional Movement in mind - it was born out of my personal desire to play VIGILANT, GLENMORIL, and UNSLAAD the way I feel they were meant to be played. Every mod in *Daedream* has been selected to offer that dark fantasy experience, with a few optional mechanics for those seeking an even more brutal experience than the baseline.

WARNING: *A Hunter's Daedream* is a mature list, as to be expected of one focused around VICN's work. It is not porn - nevernude skins ensure that, and the only HDT is for capes - but it is dark fantasy, and the mods herein draw on uncomfortable and eerie inspiration. You've been warned.



## Noteworthy Mods

### Character Creation

Using *Skyrim Unbound*, a modified *Vokrii*, *Aetherius*, *Mundustar*, *Class Overhaul Re-Imagined: CORI*, and *Early Life Evaluation - EVE*, the player has a fair bit of freedom. A swordsman, a paladin, a heroic knight or an exiled thief - whatever background you can imagine helped you survive in the Nightmare, you can play it.

### Gameplay

*Daedream* relies on SkySA to deliver a smooth, behavior-driven combat experience. *The Ultimate Dodge Mod* and *ZXLice's Backstab & Parry* deliver new ways to evade and counter enemy attacks. *Armor Rating Redux*, *Know Your Armor*, and *Resistances Rescaled* offer the player some much-needed survivability in this harsh land. *ZXlice's Ultimate Potion Animation*, *(SGC) Normal Attacks Cost Stamina* and *(SGC) Soulslike Movement and Stamina Regen* completely change the way risk management works. Furthermore, the intended settings of the game **completely remove the player's passive health regeneration**, encouraging either very deliberate combat, or very harsh and swift combat. Bring potions. Thankfully, bandits always have a lot of them. Less thankfully, draugr don't...

Enemies have gotten some new advantages, too. *Revenge of the Enemies* brings a new AI with new resistances and new defenses, off of which the incredible *Ultimate Bosses* provides some staggering setpiece battles that make old dungeons feel rough and new at the end. Further, *Know Your Enemy* will provide enemies with weaknesses to exploit.

And if it's too easy or too tough for you? *Simply Balanced* is included. There's no shame in adjusting it to your liking.

### Quests

The obvious highlight of *A Hunter's Daedream* is the Vicn trilogy - VIGILANT, GLENMORIL, and UNSLAAD - and Darkend. But those are the three everyone already knows.

*Dealing With Daedra* is a massive, sprawling mod that offers new ways to play, new organizations to interact with, and new forms of magic suitable for warlocks, witches, cultists, or hunters. *A Witcher's Adventure* further offers new magic suitable for non-mage playstyles, as well as offering players access to unique weapons and a whole new worldspace full of quests to enjoy. *Den of Cinder* similarly offers a new worldspace...one that's pitch black. Bring torches if you're wise.

*Headhunter* gives you real reasons to go do those bounty quests alongside *Trophies - An Add-On For Headhunter*. Now, when you kill a bandit leader or a giant, you get to carry their head around with you and get a bonus for it. Or you can just turn it in for money. It's up to you. This applies to the ever-present *Missives*, too.

### Appearance

The *Bijin* and *Pandorable* mods were chosen to fit the visual style of *Glenmoril Overhaul* and *Vigilant Overhaul*. While people may hate the "supermodel Skyrim" look, dark fantasy has never had shortages of pretty people, and these are the easiest mods to get going thanks to the multitude of patches present for them.

### Optionals For The Deranged

*Dark Corners of Nirn - Stress* adds a Darkest Dungeon-style Stress system into the game. While I don't personally use it, it's been presented as an option for those who want to really up the feeling of despair and hopelessness. Just...make sure you turn off the visual effect in the MCM. It's really unpleasant to look at.

*Draugnarok* has also been included as an option. The world is full of things that hate you. Do you want more of them? Turn on the Draugr and let them crawl forth from the mist. For those brave souls willing to risk quest failure - or just willing to use the alternate Synthesis patch that marks NPCs as Protected.
